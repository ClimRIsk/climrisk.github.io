"""
CRI Financial Disclosure Report Generator (PAID TIER — Professional+).

Generates structured outputs aligned to four major climate disclosure frameworks:

  1. TCFD  — Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (4 pillars)
  2. ISSB S2 — IFRS Sustainability Standard S2 (Climate-related Disclosures)
  3. EU CSRD E1 — European Sustainability Reporting Standards, Climate topic
  4. BRSR   — SEBI Business Responsibility & Sustainability Reporting (India)

Each report is produced as a structured dict which can be:
  - Serialised to JSON for API consumers
  - Rendered to PDF/Word via the reporting layer
  - Embedded in the Next.js dashboard

Framework references:
  - TCFD Final Report (2017), updated Guidance (2021)
  - IFRS S2 (June 2023), issued by ISSB
  - ESRS E1 (EU Commission Delegated Regulation 2023/2772)
  - SEBI BRSR Core (Circular SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-2/P/CIR/2023/122, July 2023)

All text in governance, strategy, and risk sections is generated from company
attributes (name, sector, hq_region, assets) so each report is substantively
different and company-specific — NOT generic boilerplate.
