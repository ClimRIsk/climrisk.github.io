"""Physical-risk resolution: hazard → expected production loss, per asset, per year.

This module is a thin orchestrator over a `PhysicalRiskProvider`
(see `providers.py`). That abstraction is what lets us swap between
internal scenario data, Continuuiti's REST API, Climate X, WRI
Aqueduct, or any future provider — without the rest of the engine
caring.

Aggregation rule (used by the internal provider): treat each hazard as
an independent annual occurrence with probability p_i; joint
no-disruption probability is Π(1 - p_i), so expected loss = 1 - Π(1 - p_i).
This caps at 100% and handles overlapping hazards sensibly.
